Ability to see own usage and compare with relevant benchmarks, e.g. number of water bottles saved due to drinking via fridge filter. 
## Cooking
Energy transparency. `Displays on premium appliances` becomes bigger and bigger with time. Likely the `mobile app` is the primary interface point but in the fuutre you would also expect this information (or parts of it) to be available on the oven display. The analytics part will however always be bigger on app (e.g., comparison versus benchmarks)

## Laundry/Dishwasher
Monitor and report water, energy usage, and detergent (volume used, liquid versus solid), as well as number of cycles and runtime.

## Refrigeration
`Only available through mobile app.` Give energy transparency, e.g.,  give the consumer transparency of how much the savings have been, and how you compare to other consumers "saved x kWh this year, xx% more than the average.
