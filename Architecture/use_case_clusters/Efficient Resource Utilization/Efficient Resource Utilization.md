<span style="color: blue; font-family: Babas; font-size: 1.4em;">Cluster:</span>Transparency of consumption, including resources (Energy, Water) and usage (# of cycles, runtime)

<span style="color: blue; font-family: Babas; font-size: 1.4em;">General Description:</span>Create  transparency of resource usage (energy, water & chemical consumption), and usage data (number of cycles or runtime) for the end-user via the phone. Ability to see own usage and compare with relevant benchmarks, e.g. number of water bottles saved due to drinking via fridge filter. 

<span style="color: blue; font-family: Babas; font-size: 1.4em;">Consumer Benefit:</span>Help me understand how I can be more resource efficient and make me feel good about doing it

## Cooking
Energy transparency. `Displays on premium appliances` becomes bigger and bigger with time. Likely the `mobile app` is the primary interface point but in the fuutre you would also expect this information (or parts of it) to be available on the oven display. The analytics part will however always be bigger on app (e.g., comparison versus benchmarks)

## Laundry/Dishwasher
Monitor and report water, energy usage, and detergent (volume used, liquid versus solid), as well as number of cycles and runtime.

## Refrigeration
`Only available through mobile app.` Give energy transparency, e.g.,  give the consumer transparency of how much the savings have been, and how you compare to other consumers "saved x kWh this year, xx% more than the average.

<span style="color: blue; font-family: Babas; font-size: 1.4em;">Cluster:</span>Adapt appliance behavior based on user context (e.g., eco-mode)

<span style="color: blue; font-family: Babas; font-size: 1.4em;">General Description:</span>Based on context of the user's situation adapt the appliance behaviour. E.g., depending on time of day, adapt which program is the default setting for Dish washer/Washing machine, recommending either the Convenience or Eco program.

<span style="color: blue; font-family: Babas; font-size: 1.4em;">Consumer Benefit:</span> Not Applicable

## Cooking
Not Applicable

## Laundry/Dishwasher
Suggest programs based on context, e.g., longer but more eco-friendly program when used over night

## Refrigeration
Adapting fridge settings depending on user behaviour, e.g., decrease fridge activity during night and cool it down in the morning just before the consumer normally rises.

# Use Case 3 <a name="use-case-3"></a>
[D.

<span style="color: blue; font-family: Babas; font-size: 1.4em;">Cluster:</span>User recommendations & actions for increasing resource efficiency

<span style="color: blue; font-family: Babas; font-size: 1.4em;">General Description:</span>Give user recommendations for increasing resource efficiency through notifications on app. 

<span style="color: blue; font-family: Babas; font-size: 1.4em;">Consumer Benefit:</span> Not Applicable

## Cooking
Optimize the pre-heating time for the oven. For hob, optimize temperature output when boiling/frying. (if you boil water for 10 sec, its equivalent to fully charge your phone). Creating awarness is important but also not to overwhelm the user with recommendations. Actions based on learned behaviour. Delegation of certain tasks. 

## Laundry/Dishwasher
Suggest programs that consume less water, energy (e.g., less degrees) & detergent without compromising results

## Refrigeration
Nudge consumer to make sustainable decisions by changing behaviour or settings. Also automatically adjust settings. E.g., automatically close fridge door if open. Give both technical suggestions (appliance configurations) and behaviour recommendations, but focus on behaviour recommendations. Appliance able to automatically change temperature and program settings in the fridge. Also, user should be able to change settings of fridge in app

<span style="color: blue; font-family: Babas; font-size: 1.4em;">Cluster:</span>Energy system integration of appliance and smart grid

<span style="color: blue; font-family: Babas; font-size: 1.4em;">General Description:</span>Appliance adapts its behaviour based on the energy price of the electricity from the public grid, e.g. delaying washing until later when price has droped. User to get the recommendations via app and see the actual savings from following recommendation and appliance make automatic adjustments.

<span style="color: blue; font-family: Babas; font-size: 1.4em;">Consumer Benefit:</span> Not Applicable

## Cooking
Not Relevant

## Laundry/Dishwasher
Adapt starts, cycle time and program choice based on energy prices

## Refrigeration
Automatic adjustment of fridge setting based on price of energy. However, marginal gain is very small unless we compromise freshness of goods. --> not super relevant for fridge. Perhaps useful for de-frost cycle, but likely minimal.

<span style="color: blue; font-family: Babas; font-size: 1.4em;">General Description:</span>Appliance adapts its behaviour based on the energy levels of the home energy system, e.g. connecting to a photovoltaic system with a battery reserve. User to get the recommendations via app and see the actual savings from following recommendation.

<span style="color: blue; font-family: Babas; font-size: 1.4em;">Consumer Benefit:</span> Not Applicable

## Cooking
Not Relevant

## Laundry/Dishwasher
Adapt starts, cycle time and program choice based on battery levels

## Refrigeration
Automatically adjust fridge settings based on battery levels and power contribution from PV system, accumulate cold and release when low levels. However, small gain for fridge.
