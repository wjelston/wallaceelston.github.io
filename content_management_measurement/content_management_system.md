Content Management System

# Process Discussion

Defining a common process for all applications that are `On Device/Appliance Applications`, `Mobile Application`, and `Web Applications` to drive reuse of graphics across all application interfaces for consistency, efficiencies in way of working, remove duplications of translations and asset mismanagement, and improve the quality and service of our CMS.  

Defining this process within the Kattegatt Project will enable a consistent way of working across our User Applications domain, aligning our leadership to a new way of working to unlock the efficiencies we need as a cross functional, cross global Corporation.

## **Goals:**  
Document the process for managing and __reusing__ content that are expressed on our `On Device/Appliance Applications`, `Mobile Application`, and `Web Applications` to provide a cohesive experience across all the applications as a part of our product portfolio.

## Problem Statement:

Currently there is no process documented for how to create and reuse the Product User Experience including graphical content, text strings (i.e. Copy), language translations that are applied to `On Device/Appliance Applications`, `Mobile Application`, and `Web Applications`.  Identify a baseline process that captures the process for each of the applications, identify the best solution for all, and document the future goal to reuse the tool chain, process, and graphical elements of this process to drive effiencies and a cohesive experience.

## Discussion Topics:

Process of developing:

1. Graphical assets
1. behavioral experience
1. Copy = text strings
1. Language Translations
1. Reuse of Graphical Assets in Content Management System
1. Interfacing to Software Token System
1. Software and Configurations Architecture "Tech Stack"

Tools applied to Process:

1. Sketch - creating Graphical Assets
1. Framer - Linking those assets to behaviors
1. ??? - Assigning text strings to the graphical assets
1. ??? - Language Translations
1. SHAPE - Reuse of Graphical Assets
1. Linux/UESWA - Interface to SW Token System
1. IoS - Interface to SW Token System
1. Android - Interface to SW Token System

## Next Topics to Discuss:

1. Graphical Assetts and interfacing to the code.
1. Information Architecture and what this looks like from Design to the Software Team.
1. Tokenization (SHAPE) and files imported into code `next steps`.
1. Mapping exercise of the process from Remy to tools that all can align with.

## Terms and Definitions

- `Localization` - Consumable in a `local market` or `region` the graphical elements, text strings, translations to languages, measurements that are needed to allow the user experience to be tailored to a consumer.
- `Copy` - definition of Text to be shown to the consumer on the `On Device/Appliance Applications`, `Mobile Application`, and `Web Applications` in Long or Short Form.
  - `Long Copy` - Articles, Terms and Conditions, Long forms of communication to a consumer in written form and including the translations of long copy content.
  - `Short Copy` - 2 or less sentences, that represent the Short form of communications to a consumer in written form and including the translations of short copy cotent.
