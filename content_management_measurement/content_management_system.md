Content Management System

# Process Discussion

Defining a common process for all applications that are `On Device/Appliance Applications`, `Mobile Application`, and `Web Applications` to drive reuse of graphics across all application interfaces for consistency, efficiencies in way of working, remove duplications of translations and asset mismanagement, adn imprve the quality and service of our CMS.  

Defining this process within the Kattegatt Project will enable a consistent way of working across our User Applications domain, aligning our leadership to a new way of working to unlock the efficiencies we need as a cross functional, cross global Corporation.
