1. Document and Review the Problem Statement with your Peers in the Systems Engineering Community for clarity surrounding the Problem Statement.
1. Identify Subject Matter Experts who can support the A3 Process to drive to the solution.  The expectations are that the assigned owner of the A3, along with the Subject Matter Experts will drive this A3 to its conclusion.
1. Once A3 is completed it will be reviewed with the Peers, Stakeholders, appropriate Managers to align all on the solution to the problem.
1. Finally A3 will be saved and closed in the appropriate Knowledge Management Repository.

## Qualifications Levels  <a name="qualification-levels"></a>

Resource: [INCOSE Competency Resource](https://www.incose.org/products-and-publications/competency-framework)
- [INCOSE.org Competency Levels.pdf](https://electrolux.sharepoint.com/sites/NEXUSSystemsEngineeringCompetence/Shared%20Documents/Forms/AllItems.aspx?id=%2Fsites%2FNEXUSSystemsEngineeringCompetence%2FShared%20Documents%2FGeneral%2FINCOSE%20Folder%2FINCOSE%20SE%20Competency%20ISECF%2Dv1%2Epdf&parent=%2Fsites%2FNEXUSSystemsEngineeringCompetence%2FShared%20Documents%2FGeneral%2FINCOSE%20Folder)
 
 
**Description:**  

The application of the fundamental concepts of systems thinking to systems engineering. These include understanding what a system is, its context within its environment, its boundaries and interfaces and that it has a lifecycle. The definition, development and production of systems within an enterprise and technological environment.
 
**Why It Matters:**  

Systems thinking is a way of dealing with increasing complexity. The fundamental concepts of systems thinking involves understanding how actions and decisions in one area affect another, and that the optimization of a system within its environment does not necessarily come from optimizing the individual system components. Systems Engineering is conducted within an enterprise and technological context. These contexts impact the lifecycle of the system and place requirements and constraints on the Systems Engineering being conducted. Failing to meet such constraints can have a serious effect on the enterprise and the value of the system
 
 
 
### Competency Levels: <a name="competency levels"></a>

- NO EXPERIENCE
- TRAINEE  (__Awareness__) - I am just starting
- NOVICE (__Supervised Practitioner__) - I just know enough to perform basic operation. I need support from my peers.
- INTERMEDIATE (__Practitioner__) - I know enough to do what I need to do in most of the cases (75%).
- ADVANCED (__Lead Practitioner__) - I am at ease to perform all I need to do.
- EXPERT (__Expert__) -  I fully master the tools (HW & SW) for what I need to do. I also support colleagues.


**No Experience**
The person has not heard of, participated in, nor experienced anything relating to Systems Engineering.

**Awareness**
The person displays knowledge of key ideas associated with the competency area and understands key issues and their implications. They ask relevant and constructive questions on the subject. This level characterizes engineers new to the competency area. It could also characterize an individual outside Systems Engineering who requires an understanding of the competency area to perform their role. 

**Supervised Practitioner**
The person displays an understanding of the competency area and has some limited experience. They require regular guidance and supervision. This level defines those engineers who are “in-training” or are inexperienced in that competency area. 

**Practitioner**
The person displays both knowledge and practical experience of the competency area and can function without supervision on a day-to-day basis. They are also capable of providing guidance and advice to less experienced practitioners. 

**Lead Practitioner**
The person displays extensive and substantial practical knowledge and experience of the competency area and provides guidance to others including practitioners encountering unusual situations. Typically, this level is associated with an individual who is the “go-to” person for advice and to determine best practice within the competency area within an organization or business unit. 

**Expert**
In addition to extensive and substantial practical experience and applied knowledge of the competency area, this individual contributes to and is recognized beyond the organizational or business boundary. Typically, this level is associated with an individual contributing to and defining regional or international best practices within the competency area.
