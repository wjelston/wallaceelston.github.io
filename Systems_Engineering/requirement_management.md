# Requirements Management Process


## Overall Decomposition Process

  </p>



  These Levels of Requirements Artifacts are as follows:

- **Level 1:** `Stakeholder`

- **Level 2:** `Mechanical and Electrical System` (Mechanical and Electrical)

- **Level 3:** `Electrical  and Electronics Subsystems` (HMI Assembly, Main Control Assembly, Auxiliary Control Assembly)

- **Level 4:** `Module` (Software, Hardware, Configurations, Tools)

- **Level 5:** `Component` (Passive and Active Component, Software Unique Libraries)

## Stakeholders Use Cases Phase

<p align="center">
  <img width="1200" src="./Documents/requirements_management/stakeholder_use_case_phase.jpg">
  </p>

  Use Cases are created by the Stakeholder describing what are the consumer need(s).

  These use cases and requirements phases are bi directional which means if there is not a use case from the stakeholder, the lower level can work to create with the business if there is a compelling reason that benefits the stakeholder.  The stakeholders can represent the business strategy, end consumer, factories, manufacturing, service, quality, privacy, and security.

## Electrical Systems Requirements Phase

  </p>

Decompose and Link in Jama Requirements Management from the Use Cases from the Stakeholder to the Systems Level Requirements.  Systems can also document system requirements and create with the stakeholders the use cases associated with those requirements.

[Horizon Electrical Systems Architecture](../Systems_Engineering/Horizon%20Systems%20Architecture.md)

Systems are made up of Subystems including:

- User Interface Subsystem Asssemblies
- Main Control Subsystem Assemblies
- Auxiliary Control Subsystems Assemblies
- Load Assemblies (eg. Motors, Pumps, Heaters)
- Sensor Assemblies (eg. RTD, Speed, Humidity)
- Switch Assemblies (eg. Door Switch, Latch Switch)
- Wiring and Harness Assemblies

## Modules Requirements Phase

<p align="center">
  <img width="1200" src="./Documents/requirements_management/module_requirements_phase.jpg">
  </p>

Software Modules are created and bundled together to create Subsystem Software.

Hardware Modules are created and bundled together to create Subsystem Hardware.

Configurations are created to allow the software and hardware to be configured for applications needs.

Tools are created to enable testing, programming, development, manufacturing and service.
