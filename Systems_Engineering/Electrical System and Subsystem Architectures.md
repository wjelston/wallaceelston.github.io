Electrical System Architectures

## Electrical System and Subsystem Architecture
Global Horizon Systems Architecture

	• Read Model/Serial Number using QR Code/Bar Code for Model and Serial Number PNC.
	• Database Server for Released: 
	
		• Software for each discrete Module
		• Software for OTA including full system over the air update for specific module.
		• Configurations for each PNC Model / Serial Number for outlining performance, features and configurations.
 
 
 
## HMI/UI Architecture
Definition:
	• (HMI) HMI Assembly includes HMI Board, UI Board, in some instances can include Power Boards also. 
	
		○ (UI) User Interface and Display
	• (PB) Power Control Boards Loads, Sensors and Switches
	• (VC) Variable Control Boards controls (Motor Controls, Inverters, Induction Boards, etc).
  
 
HMI Assembly
	• (Color Tan). HMI Board (Touch or Tactile) 2nd Surface mounts to 1st Surface Graphical Fascia.
	• (Color Black) Display (Graphical - TFT or Iconic – VFD, Display Module with static graphics)
	• Bracket (Mounts UI, Display to HMI Board)
	• UI Board (Thor, Loki, Mjolnar) (Standard Mechanical, electrical and software Interfaces)
	• Aligning with the Future HMI Assembly Systems Architecture:



 
 
 
## Power Board Architecture
Systems Engineering Organization
	• Systems Manager (SM) – Accountable for ensuring compliance to the Systems Architecture Requirements and having Systems Integrators taking from the Architects to deliver their projects, compliance to System Architecture and ensuring we are delivering for Projects using the System Integrators. 
	
		• Justin Woehler - Ovens
		• Pravin Kumar - Hobs / Hoods
		• Sandro Tarquini - Washer/Dryer/Dishwasher
		• Raony Barrios - Refrigeration
	• Systems Architect (SA) – Accountable for identifying Cross Category architecture elements, and specific focus on the category with which they deliver projects, and working cross functionally, cross regional, across Brand to gather architecture and ensure it meets projects and category needs, while maintaining a roadmap aligned with Technologies, Product line deliveries and Consumer requirements. 
	
		• Consumers include: 
		
			• End User Consumer
			• Factory
			• Service
			• Manufacturing (ECM)
			• Distribution
		• Product Lifecycle 
		
			• Exploratory
			• Concept
			• Development
			• Production
			• Utilization
			• Support
			• Retirement
		• Identifying System Requirements Architecturally: 
		
			• Tools
			• Configuration
			• UEA Stages and Modes
			• Agency (UL, IEC, FCC, Anatel, StarK, etc.)
		• Accountabilities: 
		
			• Sailia Ghavat - Cross Category/Global
			• Milka - Hoods
			• Henrike - Hobs
			• Sandro - WET/Dish/Dryer
			• Raony - Refrigeration
			• Roman Villa - Ovens
	• Systems Integrators (SI) – Accountable for the delivery of the Architecture to the Projects, configure the architecture to meet project specific needs, and identify any gaps and review those gaps with the Architect. 
	
		• Using Horizon Configure for Micro
		• Using Platform Performance and Cycles Configure for Platform
		• Using Application Configure System Relay, Sensor, Switches, HMI, Audio for project including all variants
 
Solutions Domain and Solutions Architects:
 
	• 
	
		• Mechanical Solutions Architect – Identify within the Electronics Mechanical and Product Line Teams to define interfaces, envelopes and work with UX and ID to convert functional requirements to form requirements of the UEA.
		• Hardware Solutions Architect – Identify within the Electronics Hardware Team a person to define interfaces, and solutions to the Systems Architecture and UEA the best solutions to link to the System Requirements in RM Tool for Hardware Designs.
		• Software Solutions Architect – Identify within the Electronics Software Team a person to define interfaces, and solutions to the Systems Architecture and UEA the best solutions to link to the System Requirements in RM Tool for Software Designs.
		• IoT Solutions Architect – Identify interfaces and product architecture impacts.
		• Verification and Validation Engineers – Identify Verification and Validation Engineers to start reviewing requirements and defining test cases and acceptance criteria and work to aid in the process of the V Model for Verifying requirements.
