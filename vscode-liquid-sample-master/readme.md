# Sample Project (vscode-liquid)

This directory contains a basic example Liquid project. Take a look at the workspace [.vscode/settings.json](https://github.com/panoply/vscode-liquid-sample/blob/master/.vscode/settings.json) file and the [.liquidrc](https://github.com/panoply/vscode-liquid-sample/blob/master/.liquidrc) file to better understand how the extension is working and the settings being used.

## Files

There are a couple of basic `*.liquid` files located in the `src` directory. The contents are purposefully unformatted.

#### Liquid and Markup

The `src/index.liquid` file contains Liquid + Markup.

#### Injected Sample

The files located in the `src/injection` directory show the injection grammars being applied.

#### Suffixed Files

The files located in the `src/suffixed` directory show languages infused with Liquid.

#### Ignored File

The `src/ignore-file.liquid` file is excluded from formatting as per the `ignore` setting defined in the .liquidrc file.
